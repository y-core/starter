## 1. The Isolate Model

### 1a. One Request at a Time, Recycled Isolates

Each request is handled in a V8 isolate. There is no shared heap between concurrent requests,
and there are no worker pools — everything inside a request handler runs sequentially or through
`await` chains.

**The consequence that matters is recycling, not concurrency.** An isolate handles one request
at a time, so two requests never interleave in memory — but a *second* request may reuse the
same isolate and observe whatever the first left behind at module scope. That is the leak: not a
race, a residue.

### 1b. Safe and Unsafe Module Scope

```typescript
// SAFE: computed once at cold start, never mutated
export const securityHeaders = makeSecurityHeaders({ /* … */ })
export const configStore = createConfig(appConfig, AppConfigSchema)
export const routes = route({ health: { method: "GET", pattern: "/api/health" } })

// UNSAFE: per-request mutable state at module scope
let currentUser: User | null = null
```

**Module-level constants are safe; module-level mutable state is not.** Per-request data belongs
on the request context, read through typed accessors
([`APP_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./APP_ARCHITECTURE.md) §3b).

The subtle version is a **cache**. A memo keyed on something request-scoped is per-request
mutable state wearing a performance argument; a memo keyed on something deployment-scoped — a
parsed config, a compiled schema — is a constant computed lazily and is fine.

### 1c. No Background Threads

There is no timer-driven background processing, no worker threads, and no process-level
concurrency. All async work is one of exactly two things:

1. **Awaited within the handler** — it completes before the response is returned.
2. **Handed to the execution context** — it completes after the response (§2).

There is no third option, and code written as though there were one silently loses work.

### 1d. Cold Start Versus Warm Reuse

Isolates are reused across requests when traffic is steady. **Module scope runs only on cold
start**, so module initialisation must be cheap and side-effect-free: no network connections, no
environment reads, no work whose result depends on which request happened to be first.

An expensive module-level computation is not amortised in the way it would be in a long-lived
process — it is paid on every cold start, which under bursty traffic is often.

---

## 2. Post-Response Work

### 2a. The `waitUntil` Pattern

`c.executionCtx.waitUntil(promise)` keeps the isolate alive until the promise settles, *after*
the response has been sent. Use it for work that must not block the response but must complete
before the isolate is recycled.

```typescript
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(logChannel.flush())
```

Log flushing is the canonical case: the records accumulate during the request and are written
afterwards, so storage latency never lands on the user's response time.

### 2b. Errors Do Not Propagate

**An error thrown inside a `waitUntil` promise does not reach the HTTP response** — the response
has already been sent. An unhandled rejection there is silent.

```typescript
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
  logChannel.flush().catch((err) => console.error("flush failed", err)),
)
```

Attach a catch wherever the failure is worth knowing about, which is nearly always.

### 2c. Cover Every Started Promise

**The promise handed to `waitUntil` must cover every piece of work the function started**, not
only the headline one. A detached branch inside the function — a fire-and-forget cleanup, a
probabilistic purge — is untracked, so the isolate may suspend before it settles.

The failure is load-dependent and therefore ships: under light traffic the isolate lives long
enough for the detached work to finish anyway, and the bug appears only when it matters.

### 2d. Limits

`waitUntil` work counts against the isolate's CPU budget. Keep post-response work small. Work
that is genuinely large — a bulk import, a fan-out — belongs in a queue or a durable object,
not in the tail of a request.

---

## 3. Rate Limiting

### 3a. The Rate Limit Binding

Rate limiting is configured as a platform binding with an explicit limit and period, and the
guard that consumes it returns `429` when the window is exceeded. **The limit and period live in
the deployment config, not in code** — they are an operational dial, and changing one should not
be a code review.

### 3b. Graceful Degradation Is Scoped to This

A rate-limit guard is registered with graceful degradation enabled: when the binding is absent —
in tests, or in a local run without it — the guard is skipped rather than throwing.

**This is the one place that option is correct, and it is not a precedent.** Bypassed rate
limiting is an availability concern; bypassed CSRF, origin checking, or authentication is an
integrity breach. [`BOUNDARIES.md`](./BOUNDARIES.md) §5b owns the asymmetry, and
[`CODE_REVIEW.md`](./CODE_REVIEW.md) §6 records that this specific usage is not a finding.

### 3c. Key Selection

**The default key is the client IP**, read from the platform's own connecting-IP header. That
header is trustworthy only because the request provably arrived through the platform edge — the
trust boundary [`BOUNDARIES.md`](./BOUNDARIES.md) §3c states.

**After authentication, key on identity instead.** IP-keyed limits are simultaneously too loose
for shared egress and too tight for a large NAT; once a request has an authenticated subject,
that subject is the honest key.

---

## 4. Deploy Safety

### 4a. Secrets Are Provisioned, Never Committed

**Never hardcode an API key, token, or credential in a source file.** Provision secrets through
the platform CLI, which encrypts them at rest and injects them into the environment at runtime,
where they appear alongside ordinary bindings.

A secret in git is compromised the moment it is pushed and stays compromised after it is
deleted, because history retains it. Rotation is the only remedy, and it is not a code change.

### 4b. Local Development Variables

Local development reads secrets from a **gitignored variables file**, with obviously non-production
values. Two rules: **verify it is gitignored before adding the first value**, and **commit an
example file** listing the required keys with placeholder values, so a new checkout fails with a
missing-key error rather than a mysterious one.

### 4c. The Pre-Deploy Gate

**The full verification gate must pass before every deployment**, and a failure blocks the
deploy ([`TESTING.md`](./TESTING.md) §6). Asset builds run before deploy, not as part of it.

**Never use a force flag to skip build or asset validation.** The validation exists because a
deploy that half-succeeds leaves markup pointing at assets that were never uploaded, and the
symptom is an unstyled production site.

### 4d. Environment Parity

**The config schema validates the environment at request time**, so a missing or malformed
variable throws a structured error naming the field rather than defaulting silently
([`ERROR_HANDLING.md`](./ERROR_HANDLING.md) §5e).

This is what makes staging worth having: a misconfiguration surfaces as an immediate, legible
failure in the first environment it reaches, instead of as a subtly wrong behaviour in the last
one.

## 5. Static Assets

### 5a. The Public Directory and Build Outputs

Stylesheets, client bundles, images, and fonts are emitted into a public directory that the
platform uploads and serves from its edge. **The directory is build output, not source** — it is
generated by the asset pipeline from the application's stylesheet entry and client entry.

### 5b. Serve Assets Before the Worker

**Configure static assets to be served without invoking the Worker.** Routing an asset request
through a handler spends CPU on a file that needs no dynamic logic and bypasses edge caching.

### 5c. Cache Busting

Where the pipeline does not fingerprint filenames, cache correctness depends on the platform's
own asset versioning. **If fingerprinting is added, the markup that references the assets must be
updated in the same change** — a fingerprinted file with an unfingerprinted reference is a 404
that only appears after the first deploy.

### 5d. Never Serve Files From a Handler

**Do not add a route that reads and returns a file from the public directory.** It wastes CPU,
bypasses the edge cache, and — worse — introduces a path-handling surface where directory
traversal becomes possible. The asset pipeline has no such surface because it never takes a path
from a request.
